# Submissions — Simplified Upload Instructions and Rubric

## Overview
This section provides a step-by-step framework for students to correctly prepare and upload their coding projects for assessment.  
The goal is to standardize submissions, ensure visibility, and minimize upload challenges—especially for users unfamiliar with GitHub folder creation.

---

## Folder Naming Convention (Mandatory)

Each student must submit their project inside a folder named in the following format:

`Firstname_Lastname_ProjectName`

**Example:**  
`Oluwasegunfunmi_Oyekanmi_ExpenseTracker`

This ensures each submission can be clearly identified during evaluation.

---

## Folder Structure — What to Include

Inside your project folder, please include:

1. **`README.md`**  
   A short documentation file describing:
   - How to run the project (exact steps or commands).  
   - Any required files or dependencies.  
   - Main features implemented.  
   - Optional stretch goals or creative enhancements.

2. **Project Source Files**
   - For **Scratch Projects:** Include the `.sb3` file(s) and any assets.  
   - For **Python Projects:** Include `.py` files and any resource files such as `data.txt` or `questions.json`.

3. **(Optional) `evidence/` Folder**  
   - Contain screenshots or short video clips showing the project running successfully.

## Step-by-Step Submission Process

To simplify the upload process, especially for those unfamiliar with GitHub folder management, follow these steps carefully:

### Step 1 — Prepare Your Project Folder
1. On your computer, create a **new folder** named using the format:  
   `Firstname_Lastname_ProjectName`
2. Move all your project files (e.g., `.py`, `.sb3`, `README.md`, `data.txt`, etc.) into this folder.

---

### Step 2 — Organize Multiple Projects (if applicable)
If you have **more than one project**, put all your individual project folders inside a **main folder** named with your full name only, e.g.:  
`Oluwasegunfunmi_Oyekanmi`

Your structure should look like this:

```

Oluwasegunfunmi_Oyekanmi/
│
├── Oluwasegunfunmi_Oyekanmi_ExpenseTracker/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── main.py
│   └── evidence/
│
└── Oluwasegunfunmi_Oyekanmi_QuizApp/
├── README.md
├── quiz.py
└── evidence/

```

---

### Step 3 — Compress (Zip) Your Folder
1. Right-click the main folder (with your name).  
2. Select **“Send to → Compressed (zipped) folder”** or **“Compress”** depending on your system.  
3. This will create a `.zip` file — e.g.,  
   `Oluwasegunfunmi_Oyekanmi.zip`

---

### Step 4 — Upload to GitHub
1. Visit the GitHub repository for the **Holiday Project Submissions**.  
2. Open the `/submissions` folder.  
3. Click **“Add file” → “Upload files”**.  
4. Drag and drop your `.zip` file into the upload window.  
5. Scroll down and click **“Commit changes”** with a message such as:  
   `Upload submission: Oluwasegunfunmi_Oyekanmi`

## Visual Submission Workflow

```

+-------------------------+
|   Create Project Folder |
| (Firstname_Lastname_...)|
+-----------+-------------+
|
v
+-------------------------+
|   Add All Project Files |
|  (.py / .sb3 / README)  |
+-----------+-------------+
|
v
+-------------------------+
|  Zip Main Folder (Name) |
|   → Creates .zip file   |
+-----------+-------------+
|
v
+-------------------------+
|  Upload .zip to GitHub  |
|  via /submissions path  |
+-----------+-------------+
|
v
+-------------------------+
| Commit with Message:    |
| "Upload submission: ..."|
+-------------------------+

```

## Submission Guidelines
- Ensure all code runs correctly before zipping.  
- Only **one zipped folder per student** should be uploaded.  
- Do **not** upload project folders individually. Always zip first.  
- Avoid using external Python libraries unless approved.  
- Add screenshots or videos (optional) for better presentation.

---

## Grading Rubric

| Criteria | Weight | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **Functionality** | 50% | Project performs all required tasks and meets objectives. |
| **Code Quality & Comments** | 20% | Code is readable, properly indented, and well-commented. |
| **UI / Usability** | 15% | Clear, intuitive interface and user experience. |
| **Creativity / Extensions** | 15% | Original ideas, enhancements, or unique problem-solving. |

## Teacher Notes
- Missing files or unclear documentation will prompt resubmission requests.  
- Projects using third-party libraries without prior approval will lose points.  
- Including visual evidence (screenshots or demos) helps verify execution.

## Troubleshooting Upload Issues

### 1. **File Too Large to Upload**
If your `.zip` file is **larger than 25 MB**, GitHub may reject it through the web interface.  
**Solutions:**
- Remove any unnecessary video or large media files before zipping.  
- If still too large, upload your `.zip` to **Google Drive** or **Dropbox**, then share the link in your project’s README file.

### 2. **Upload Freezes or Fails**
If GitHub upload stalls:
- Try again after refreshing the page.  
- Ensure your internet connection is stable.  
- Use a modern browser such as **Google Chrome** or **Microsoft Edge**.  
- If the problem persists, clear browser cache or try using **GitHub Desktop**.

### 3. **Accidentally Uploaded Wrong File**
- Go to your submission in the `/submissions` folder.  
- Click the **trash icon** (if you have edit access) or inform the instructor to remove it.  
- Re-upload the correct `.zip` file with a new commit message:  
  `Replace submission: Firstname_Lastname_ProjectName`

### 4. **Forgot to Zip Before Uploading**
- Delete the unzipped upload from the `/submissions` folder.  
- Compress your folder and upload again as a single `.zip` file.

### 5. **Cannot See “Add File” or “Upload Files” Button**
- Ensure you are signed in with the **correct GitHub account**.  
- Make sure you have been **granted collaborator access** to the repository.  
- If access is missing, contact your teacher or team lead.

### Final Tip
Always test your project before zipping and confirm your folder name matches the required format.  
Consistency accelerates review and ensures your work gets the credit it deserves.
