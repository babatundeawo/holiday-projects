# Submissions — Upload Instructions and Rubric

## Folder Naming (Required)
Each student must create a folder inside `/submissions` using the following format:

`Firstname_Lastname_ProjectName`

**Example:**  
`Babatunde_Awoyemi_ExpenseTracker`

This naming convention ensures every submission can be easily identified and reviewed.

## Required Files Inside the Student Folder
Each project folder must contain the following:

- **`README.md`** — Short project documentation that includes:
  - How to run the project (exact steps or commands for IDLE or Scratch).
  - Required dependencies (only Python standard library should be used).
  - Key features implemented.
  - Optional improvements or stretch goals.

- **Source Files**
  - **Scratch Projects:** `.sb3` file(s) and any additional assets.
  - **Python Projects:** `.py` files and any required resource files (for example, `questions.json` or `data.txt`).

- **`evidence/` Folder (Optional)** — Screenshots or short videos demonstrating the project in action.

## Submission Guidelines
1. All submissions must be uploaded inside the `/submissions` directory.
2. Each folder should contain only **one project**.
3. Ensure code runs without errors before submission.
4. Commit changes with a clear message such as  
   `Add submission: Firstname_Lastname_ProjectName`.
