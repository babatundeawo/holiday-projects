## 🌟 Overview
This section provides a step-by-step framework for students to correctly prepare and upload their coding projects for assessment.  
The goal is to standardize submissions, ensure visibility, and minimize upload challenges—especially for users unfamiliar with GitHub folder creation.

> ⚠️ **Important Update:** All submissions should now be uploaded as **.zip files to the Google Drive folder** provided above. GitHub uploads are no longer required.

---

## 🏷 Folder Naming Convention (Mandatory)

Each student must submit their project inside a folder named in the following format:

`Firstname_Lastname_ProjectName`

**Example:**  
`Oluwasegunfunmi_Oyekanmi_ExpenseTracker`

✅ This ensures each submission can be clearly identified during evaluation.

---

## 📁 Folder Structure — What to Include

Inside your project folder, please include:

1. **`README.md`**  
   Describe:
   - How to run the project (exact steps or commands).  
   - Any required files or dependencies.  
   - Main features implemented.  
   - Optional stretch goals or creative enhancements.

2. **Project Source Files**
   - **Scratch Projects:** `.sb3` file(s) + assets  
   - **Python Projects:** `.py` files + resources (`data.txt`, `questions.json`, etc.)

3. **Optional `evidence/` Folder**  
   - Screenshots or short videos showing the project running successfully.

---

## 🛠 Step-by-Step Submission Process

### Step 1 — Prepare Your Project Folder 🗂
1. On your computer, create a **new folder** using the format:  
   `Firstname_Lastname_ProjectName`
2. Move all your project files into this folder (`.py`, `.sb3`, `README.md`, etc.)

---

### Step 2 — Organize Multiple Projects 📦
If you have **more than one project**, place all individual project folders inside a **main folder** named with your full name, e.g.:  
`Oluwasegunfunmi_Oyekanmi`

Example structure:

```

Oluwasegunfunmi_Oyekanmi/
│
├── Oluwasegunfunmi_Oyekanmi_ExpenseTracker/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── main.py
│   └── evidence/
│
└── Oluwasegunfunmi_Oyekanmi_QuizApp/
├── README.md
├── quiz.py
└── evidence/

```

---

### Step 3 — Compress (Zip) Your Folder 🗜
1. Right-click the main folder → **Send to → Compressed (zipped) folder** (Windows) or **Compress** (Mac).  
2. This creates a `.zip` file:  
   `Oluwasegunfunmi_Oyekanmi.zip`

---

### Step 4 — Upload to Google Drive ☁️
1. Click the **Submit Your Project** badge above or open the link:  
   [Upload Here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ottoq9wLuW6iJ4v4vPjGSDp09MiFsi5D?usp=sharing)  
2. Drag and drop your **.zip file** into the folder.  
3. Ensure the file name matches the folder name format exactly.  
4. Wait for the upload to finish — confirm your `.zip` file is visible.

---

## 🚀 Quick Google Drive Upload Steps

1. Open the Google Drive folder using the badge or link above  
2. Click **“+ New”** → **File upload**  
3. Select your **.zip file** → click **Open**  
4. Wait for the progress bar to finish  
5. Verify your file appears in the folder ✅

> 💡 Tip: Use a stable internet connection for large files and refresh the page if upload fails.
