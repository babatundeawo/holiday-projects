## üéØ Project Overview

### Scratch Programming

Students will attempt these projects in increasing order of difficulty. Each project has a PDF guide inside the `scratch-guides/` folder.

1. Jumping Game
2. Virtual Pet
3. Catch Game
4. Video Sensing
5. Make It Fly

Optional `.sb3` starter templates can be found in the `scratch-starters/` folder (if provided).

### Python Programming

Students will build **real-world capstone projects** they can run directly in IDLE.
Step-by-step guides will be in the `python-guides/` folder and sample code in `python-samples/`.

Example projects:

1. **Personal Expense Tracker**
2. **Quiz Game with Score Tracking**
3. **File Organizer App**

Each project is self-contained and uses only Python‚Äôs standard library.

## üöÄ Student Submission Instructions

Each student must create a folder under `/submissions/` using this exact format:

```
Firstname_Lastname_ProjectName
```

**Example:**

```
Babatunde_Awoyemi_ExpenseTracker
```

### Inside that folder, include

* Source code (`.py` or `.sb3` files)
* A short `README.md` explaining:

  * What the project does
  * How to run it
  * Any unique features added
* (Optional) `screenshot.png` or `demo.gif` showing your project running

### General Rules

* Python projects must run directly in IDLE or VS Code (no external libraries).
* Scratch projects must open and run in the Scratch editor.
* Keep folder and file names clean ‚Äî **no spaces!**

## üßë‚Äçüè´ Instructor Workflow

1. **Publish this repository** using GitHub Desktop.
2. **Enable GitHub Pages** (optional) to serve the `site/` folder for students to browse projects.
3. **Share the repository link** and GitHub Pages URL with students.
4. **Review submissions** in `/submissions/` or via pull requests (for advanced students).
